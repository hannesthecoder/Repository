Learning Spikes & Self-Directed Projects

This repository documents periods where I deliberately compressed difficult learning curves
or executed under high-pressure, real-world conditions alongside existing commitments.

## Latin (12-month intensive)

- Self-taught Latin to advanced reading fluency in 12 months.
- Followed a daily routine of grammar drills, translation, and direct reading of classical texts, in parallel with the standard school curriculum.
- Covered material typically spread over a 4 year curriculum.
- Focus was on speed, retention, and first-principles understanding.

Outcome:
- Comfortable translating unadapted classical prose with dictionary support.

## Live Music Performance
- Performed original music as a DJ to large live audiences in public venues.
- Prepared and tested sets through rehearsal and live iteration.
- Executed performances under uncertainty, real-time audience feedback, and high social exposure.

Outcome:
- Developed comfort with public evaluation and high-pressure execution.
- Built reliability in delivering performance in non-reversible, real-world settings.
